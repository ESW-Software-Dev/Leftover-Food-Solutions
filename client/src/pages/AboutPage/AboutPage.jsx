        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          This website was created as part of LeftoverFoodSolutions, a sub-team
          within Engineers For A Sustainable World. At Cornell University,
          numerous clubs and organizations regularly host events with food and
          drinks. Often, these events end with leftover food that needs to be
          distributed. Our platform aims to address this issue by promoting
          leftover food from campus events. By doing so, we aim to tackle both
          food insecurity and waste on campus. Through our platform, students
          can easily share leftover food from events or meetings using either
          the mobile app or web interface. Other students can then effortlessly
          find available options through this platform. This will allow leftover
          food to be used up by students who want it, fostering sustainability
          on campus.

        <h2>Cornell's Food Waste: Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          Every week, Cornell University generates two tons of wasted food,
          which is equivalent to approximately 8,000 meals. So, as a campus, we
          waste 8,000 meals every single week. Annually, Cornell dining halls
          and small eateries across campus produce 800 tons of food scraps and
          organic kitchen waste. These numbers highlight the scale of food waste
          on campus, which is why it is so important to implement strategies to
          minimize waste.
